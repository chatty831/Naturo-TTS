However, the main point is to introduce you to the various things you should consider when fine tuning XTTS-v2. The tips/advice/guides in the official coqui [docs](https://docs.coqui.ai/en/latest/) are great, but it's not always clear which docs content pertains to which model/s.\n\nThis notebook has been tested with its original environment, Persistence set to 'Files only' and accelerator set to GPU P100.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating Your Dataset:\n\n\n### Dataset of this Notebook:\nThe dataset attached to this notebook comes from the freely available [M-AILABS Speech DataSet](https://www.caito.de/2019/01/03/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/). (It is supposed to be a UK English speaker reading the novel Jane Eyre, but to my ears sounds more like a US English speaker putting on an accent.)\n\n### Preparing your own Data:\nI am assuming you want to fine-tune on your own data. Load your audio files into [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), select them, and export as WAV (channels: mono, sample rate: 22050, encoding: Signed 16-bit PCM).\n\nDoing additional audio pre-processing in Audacity is risky. My experiments with normalising loudness between different source audio recordings ended up creating a voice that was lacking in dynamic range. Similarly, my attempts to remove noise from source recordings also removed too much of the actual voice/signal and ended up producing bad results. \n\nMy advice (unless you are experienced with working with audio or you have a lot of time to play around) is just to listen to the audio you're thinking of using and have a quick look at the wave forms/spectrograms in Audacity. Simply discard any audio that is significantly worse quality than the rest. Examples of unpromising source audio include: constant background noise (e.g., coughing, clapping, laughter), excessive clipping in waveform view of Audacity, poor quality recording with constant whine/noise/etc. .\n\n### Making an LJSpeech Style Dataset:\nThe format for LJSpeech is a dir that contains two things: a metadata.csv file and a dir called 'wavs' that contains your voice recordings. Each line of the metadata.csv file includes:\n\n1. The name of an audio file\n2. The text for that file. E.g., \"Jane eyre by Charlotte Bronte. Chapter 1.\"\n3. The normalised text. E.g., \"Jane eyre by Charlotte Bronte. Chapter one.\"\n\n**If you are fine-tuning XTTS-v2 you don't need to worry about normalising your text, because it gets done for you automatically at training time. So your second and third columns can be identical.**\n\n[Here](https://github.com/zuverschenken/XTTSv2Scripts) is my github repo showing how to create an LJSpeech style dataset from 1 or more WAV files that may contain multiple speakers. (Alternatively you can try the [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) project for this task.)\n\nAfter you have finished with these, your dataset will be in the LJSpeech format and ready for use with this notebook.\n\n[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maxbr0wn/inspect-tts-dataset/) is my kaggle notebook showing you how to check the quality of your dataset and sanitise it.\n\n### Note on Model Performance:\nSome degree of repetition/mushy mouth sounds seems to be inherent to the model. Even the pre-trained voices that comes packaged with TTS suffer from this problem to a small extent. There are two ways I'm aware of to improve your performance (these are already covered in other parts of this/my other notebook, but I'm putting it here again since it's pretty important):\n\n1. Improve the quality of your training data. Cull problematic items. Get more training data if your dataset is really small.\n2. The model does not generalise well to unseen sequence lengths. If you only fine-tune on 10s long audio clips and then try to produce a 1s clip at inference time, it will probably struggle. Make sure you have a good distribution of training lengths. Note that when you try to generate audio from a long text string, *this program is automatically splitting that long string of text into several shorter strings*, because the model cannot generate sequences of arbitrary length. If you are suffering from garbled/repetitious outputs, then I recommend putting some print statements in the 'split_sentence\" function in TTS.tts.layers.xtts.tokenizer. This will show you how your long text is being split up. If you see that your bad outputs are only occuring when the model is trying to generate audio for very short sequences or very long sequences, then you know what needs to be addressed.

It can completely change how your model will sound. Even two clips taken from the same recording of the same speaker can produce markedly different outputs. Unfortunately I can't provide an algorithm for selecting this. I recommend that you manually go through your dataset and select approximately 10 clips of your speaker where they are saying a full sentence with an intonation/rythm/speed/style that sounds pretty good. Then just experiment with all of them and find one you like. This is especially important at inference time.\n\nNote that you can give a speaker reference that 'doesn't belong' to your model. For example if you want to make a US English speaker model impersonate a UK English speaker, you can provide it with a UK speaker reference file.

A common problem when fine-tuning/training generative models is encountered here: we don't have a satisfactory algorithm for evaluating which outputs are superior. After a few epochs the decreases in loss are small and it's difficult to tell by listening to the test outputs whether things are improving or not. I personally have ended training after roughly 100,000 dataset items put through the trainer (i.e., 20 epochs with a dataset of 5,000 audio files). If you are listening to the test outputs and your model is performing well after just a few epochs, then you can finish early.
